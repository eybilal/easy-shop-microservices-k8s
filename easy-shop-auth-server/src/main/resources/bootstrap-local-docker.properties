# The default behavior for any microservice that has the Spring Cloud Config Client
# on the classpath is as follows:
# When a config client starts, it binds to the Config Server
# (through the spring.cloud.config.uri bootstrap configuration property)
# and initializes Spring Environment with remote property sources.
#
# Solution ==> All client applications that want to consume the Config Server need a
# bootstrap-local-ide.properties/yml  (or an environment variable) with the server address set
# in spring.cloud.config.uri configuration property

spring.cloud.config.uri=http://easy-shop-config-server:8888

# Fail the startup if it cannot connect to the Config Server
spring.cloud.config.failFast=true
